                <h1>About St. Louis</h1>
				<p>
					St. Louis is the second-largest city in Missouri. 
					It sits near the confluence of the Mississippi and the 
					Missouri Rivers. In 2020, the city proper had a 
					population of 301,578, while the bi-state metropolitan 
					area, which extends into Illinois, had an estimated 
					population of over 2.8 million, making it the largest 
					metropolitan area in Missouri, the second-largest in 
					Illinois, and the 20th-largest in the United States.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before European settlement, the area was a regional 
					center of Native American Mississippian culture. 
					St. Louis was founded on February 14, 1764, by French 
					fur traders Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent, Pierre Laclède 
					and Auguste Chouteau, who named it for Louis IX of France. 
					In 1764, following France's defeat in the Seven Years' War, 
					the area was ceded to Spain. In 1800, it was retroceded to 
					France, which sold it three years later to the United 
					States as part of the Louisiana Purchase; the city was 
					then the point of embarkation for the Corps of Discovery on 
					the Lewis and Clark Expedition. In the 19th century, St.
					Louis became a major port on the Mississippi River; from 
					1870 until the 1920 census, it was the fourth-largest city 
					in the country. It separated from St. Louis County in 1877, 
					becoming an independent city and limiting its political 
					boundaries. In 1904, it hosted the Louisiana Purchase 
					Exposition and the Summer Olympics.
				</p>
				<p>
					A "Gamma" global city with a metropolitan GDP of more 
					than $160 billion in 2017, metropolitan St. Louis has 
					a diverse economy with strengths in the service, manufacturing,
					trade, transportation, and tourism industries. It is home to 
					eight Fortune 500 companies. Major companies headquartered or 
					with significant operations in the city include Ameren 
					Corporation, Peabody Energy, Nestlé Purina PetCare, Anheuser-Busch, 
					Wells Fargo Advisors, Stifel Financial, Spire, Inc., 
					MilliporeSigma, FleishmanHillard, Square, Inc., U.S. Bank, 
					Anthem BlueCross and Blue Shield, Federal Reserve Bank of 
					St. Louis, U.S. Department of Agriculture, National 
					Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Centene Corporation, and 
					Express Scripts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Major research universities include Saint Louis University and 
					Washington University in St. Louis. The Washington University 
					Medical Center in the Central West End neighborhood hosts an 
					agglomeration of medical and pharmaceutical institutions, 
					including Barnes-Jewish Hospital.
